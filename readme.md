# Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)

The Catch License is a license designed to simplify the process of creating and sharing compatibility patches for software modifications ("mods"). Mods often enhance our favorite games, but they don't always work together smoothly. Compatibility patches solve this problem by allowing different mods to function together.

It provides a clear framework that encourages collaboration between mod authors and patch creators while ensuring respect for original work.

## Key Goals of the Catch License

- **Support for Compatibility**: Makes it easy for patch creators to create and share their work.
- **Respect for Mod Authors**: Ensures proper attribution and protects original assets.
- **Transparency**: Requires patches to be open-source for community visibility.
- **Fairness**: Prevents unauthorized monetization of compatibility patches.

The full Catch License text is available in the [cl.md](./cl.md) file.

## Why Use the Catch License?

The Catch License is built to foster collaboration while protecting the interests of everyone involved:

### For Mod Authors

It provides a structured way to permit compatibility patches while ensuring your work is respected.

### For Patch Creators

It gives you clear and fair permissions to create and distribute patches responsibly.

### For Everyone

The Catch License removes ambiguity, so both sides know what to expect and how to proceed.

## For Mod Authors: Why Apply the Catch License?

By licensing your mod under the Catch License, you make it clear that compatibility patches are welcome—as long as they follow simple, respectful guidelines. Here's what the Catch License does for you:

1. **Ensures Proper Credit**: Patch creators must credit you and your work.
2. **Limits Asset Use**: Your assets can only be used for compatibility purposes, not for unrelated projects.
3. **Promotes Transparency**: All patches must be open-source, giving you and the community full visibility into changes.
4. **Controls Monetization**: No one can profit off patches for your mod without your explicit permission.

### How to Apply the Catch License to Your Mod

To license your mod under the Catch License, simply do one of the following or both:

- Include the Catch License file in your mod's files or repository.
- Add a note in your mod's description (on platforms like Nexus Mods or GitHub) that it follows the Catch License. Example:

	> This mod is licensed under the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](https://github.com/catch-group/cl/blob/1.0.0/cl.md). Compatibility patches must comply with its terms.

## For Patch Creators: What Does the Catch License Mean?

If you're creating a compatibility patch for a mod licensed under the Catch License, you must follow these guidelines:

1. **Credit the Original Work**:
	- Name the original mod(s) and their author(s).
	- Provide a link to the mod's official page in your patch's description.

2. **Include a Disclaimer**:
	- If you're not affiliated with the mod author(s), add this statement:
	  > This compatibility patch is an independent creation and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by the original author(s) of the mods involved.

3. **Keep Your Patch Open Source**:
	- Make your patch's source code publicly available.
	- Include a copy of or a link to the Catch License or any other compatible license.

4. **Use Assets Responsibly**:
	- Only use the original mod's assets when strictly necessary for compatibility. Anything beyond that requires explicit permission. See [here](./docs/assets.md) for more details.

5. **Respect Monetization Rules**:
	- Paid downloads or revenue-sharing systems (e.g., Nexus Mods Donation Points) are prohibited unless explicitly allowed by the original mod author(s) and the platform.
	- General donation links are allowed if:
	  - Donation links for the original mod author(s) are equally prominent, or
	  - The original author(s) have publicly allowed alternative monetization methods.

### How to Apply the Catch License to Your Patch

To license your patch under the Catch License, simply do one of the following or preferably both:

1. Include the Catch License file in your patch's files or repository.
2. Add a note in your patch's description that it follows the Catch License. Example:

	> This compatibility patch is licensed under the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](https://github.com/catch-group/cl/blob/1.0.0/cl.md). Compatibility patches must comply with its terms.

## Why Open Source?

The Catch License's open-source requirement isn't just a formality. Transparency ensures that:

- Mod authors and users know exactly what's being changed.
- Other patch creators can learn from and build upon existing work.
- The modding community benefits from a culture of collaboration and trust.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a Compatibility Patch?

A compatibility patch is a secondary mod designed to resolve conflicts or enable functionality between two or more mods.

### Can I monetize my Compatibility Patch?

Not directly. The Catch License restricts paid downloads or revenue-sharing unless all involved parties—including platforms—explicitly agree. For example, on Nexus Mods, if a mod page includes this permission:

> **Asset use permission in mods/files that earn donation points**
>
> You are allowed to earn Donation Points for your mods if they use my assets

then you may enable Donation Points for your patch.

If a mod pages includes this (non-)permission:

> **Asset use permission in mods/files that earn donation points**
>
>You are not allowed to earn Donation Points for your mods if they use my assets

then Donation Points cannot be enabled for your patch.

It's worth noting that some might argue a patch doesn't always incorporate the original mod's assets, especially when it involves universal, non-copyrightable components like numbers, colors, or other basic data. However, in the context of the Catch License, creating a patch inherently constitutes "using assets" from the original mod.

While technical loopholes may exist, the intent of the License is to maintain simplicity, fairness, and transparency in the modding community.

Donation links are always allowed under certain conditions (see [above](#for-patch-creators-what-does-the-catch-license-mean)).

### What if the original mod has stricter rules?

The Catch License only applies to compatibility patches. If the original mod's license imposes stricter restrictions, those must be followed.

### Can I use assets from the original mod?

Yes, but only as much as needed to achieve compatibility. Anything beyond that requires explicit permission.
