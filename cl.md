A software modification or add-on created to enhance or alter the functionality or content of a game or application.

### 1.2. "Author"

The creator(s) of a Mod to which this License applies.

### 1.3. "Compatibility Patch"

A secondary Mod developed to enable or improve compatibility between two or more Mods, allowing them to function together without conflicts.

### 1.4. "Patch Creator"

An individual or entity that develops and distributes a Compatibility Patch.

### 1.5. "Assets"

Files or materials, such as models, textures, scripts, sounds, or other proprietary elements included in a Mod.

### 1.6. "Licensed Rights"

The rights granted under this License, limited to enabling the creation and distribution of Compatibility Patches under the conditions outlined herein.

## 2. License Grant

The Author grants the Patch Creator the worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable right to create, reproduce, distribute, and publicly display Compatibility Patches for the Mod, provided the Patch Creator complies with the conditions of this License.

## 3. Scope of the License

### 3.1. Application of the License

This License applies only to the Mod to which it is explicitly attached by the Author. It does not override or affect any licenses or permissions associated with other Mods.

### 3.2. Irrevocability

Once applied to a specific version of the Mod, this License is irrevocable for that version. Future versions may be distributed under different terms at the Author's discretion, but this does not retroactively affect the rights granted under this License for prior versions.

### 3.3. Relationship with Existing Permissions

This License supplements existing permissions or licenses provided by the Author. It may grant additional permissions but does not impose additional restrictions beyond those already in place for the Mod.

## 4. License Conditions

The Patch Creator's exercise of the Licensed Rights is subject to the following conditions:

### 4.1. Attribution

The Patch Creator must provide clear and visible attribution to the Author of the Mod. Attribution must include:

- The name of the Mod and its Author.
- A link to the Mod's distribution page this License is attached to.

Attribution must appear in the description of the Compatibility Patch on distribution platforms and in any accompanying documentation.

### 4.2. Disclaimer

If the Patch Creator is not affiliated with the Author, the following disclaimer must be displayed in the description of the Compatibility Patch on distribution platforms and in any accompanying documentation:

> This compatibility patch is an independent creation and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by the author(s) of the mods involved.

### 4.3. Open Source Requirement

Compatibility Patches must be distributed under this License or any other license that:

- **Maintains Attribution**: Requires attribution to the Patch Creator as outlined in Section 4.1, including the name of the Compatibility Patch, the Patch Creator, and a link to the Compatibility Patch's distribution page.
- **Attribution Continuity:** Limits attribution requirements for Compatibility Patches based on this Compatibility Patch to the immediate predecessor. Patch Creators of these downstream Compatibility Patches must attribute only the immediate predecessor (Patch Creator) as outlined in Section 4.1 and are not required to include attribution for the Author of the Mod or any upstream contributors.
- **Ensures Transparency:** Makes the source code of the Compatibility Patch publicly available.
- **Is equally or more permissive:** Does not impose additional restrictions conflicting with the rights granted and conditions given under this License.

### 4.4. Asset Usage

Use of Mod Assets is permitted solely to the extent necessary to achieve compatibility between Mods.

The use of Assets is allowed for the following purposes:

- Addressing specific conflicts or interoperability issues without creating standalone content unrelated to compatibility.
- Maintaining the intended functionality or appearance of the Mod when used in conjunction with other Mods.

When using Assets, the Patch Creator must:

- Adhere to any explicit restrictions in the Mod's existing licenses or permissions, unless such restrictions conflict with the rights granted under this License for compatibility purposes.
- Only include the minimal portion of the Assets required to resolve a compatibility issue.

The use of Assets is expressly prohibited where the Assets are utilized beyond the resolution of compatibility issues, including but not limited to:

- Creating derivative works, expansions, or standalone content unrelated to compatibility.
- Extracting Assets for use in unrelated projects or products.

### 4.5. Monetization

Compatibility Patches may not be monetized through paid downloads or revenue-sharing systems without explicit permission from the Author and compliance with the platform's policies. General donation links are permitted only if:

- Donation links for the Author are included and equally prominent, or
- Explicit permission has been granted by the Author for monetization under different or no conditions.

Platform-specific rules on monetization may further restrict or permit certain activities. The Patch Creator must comply with both this License and the policies of the distribution platform.

## 5 No Warranty

The Licensed Rights are provided "as-is" and "as-available," without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Author be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Licensed Rights granted under this License.

## 7. Term and Termination

The Licensed Rights are granted for the duration of the copyright term of the Mod, provided that the Patch Creator remains in compliance with this License. If the Patch Creator violates the License conditions, their rights under this License are automatically terminated until the violation is cured.

## 8. Severability

If any provision of this License is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The remainder of the License shall remain in full force and effect.

## 9. Relation to Other Agreements

This License constitutes the agreement between the Author and Patch Creators concerning Compatibility Patches for the Mod. It supplements but does not supersede or nullify any prior agreements or licenses related to the Mod, except where explicitly stated.
