# For Mod Authors

Applying the Catch License to your mod signals that compatibility patches are welcome, as long as they follow clear, fair guidelines.

## Benefits

1. **Ensures Proper Credit**: Patch creators must acknowledge you and your mod.
2. **Limits Asset Use**: Assets can only be used when strictly necessary for compatibility.
3. **Promotes Transparency**: All compatibility patches must be open-source, fostering trust.
4. **Respects Your Terms**: Patch creators cannot grant or alter rights they do not own, ensuring your conditions—such as any separate monetization policies you enforce—remain intact.

## How to Apply the Catch License

- Include the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](../cl.md) in your mod's files or repository.
- Replace `[YEAR]` and `[COPYRIGHT HOLDER]` with the appropriate details.
- Add a note in your mod's description:

	> This mod is licensed under the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](https://github.com/catch-group/cl/blob/1.0.0/cl.md).
	> Compatibility patches must comply with its terms.
