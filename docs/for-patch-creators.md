# For Patch Creators

If you're creating a compatibility patch for a mod under the Catch License, you must follow specific guidelines to ensure your patch is compliant.

## Responsibilities

1. **Credit the Original Work**
	- Name the original mod(s) and author(s).
	- Link to the mod's official distribution page, if available.

2. **Include a Disclaimer (if not affiliated)**
	> This compatibility patch is an independent creation and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by the original author(s) of the mods involved.

3. **Open Source and License Your Patch**
	- Make your patch's source code publicly available.
	- Include a copy of or link to the [Catch License](../cl.md).

4. **Use Assets Responsibly**
	- Use the author's assets only if strictly necessary for compatibility.
	- Do not alter asset usage rules for content you don't fully own.
	- For examples and best practices, see [Asset Usage](./for-patch-creators/asset-usage.md).

5. **Check Monetization Policies**
	- The Catch License does not prohibit monetization, but platform rules, community norms, or the author's own terms may discourage or prohibit it.
	- Before adding donation links or other forms of monetization, ensure it's allowed by the Mod Author and the platform's policies.

6. **No Unauthorized Permissions**
	- You cannot grant or alter rights you do not fully own. Doing so violates the License.

## How to Apply the Catch License

- Include the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](../cl.md) in your patch's files or repository.
- Replace `[YEAR]` and `[COPYRIGHT HOLDER]` with the appropriate details.
- Add a note in your patch's description:

	> This compatibility patch is licensed under the [Catch License 1.0.0 (CL-1.0.0)](https://github.com/catch-group/cl/blob/1.0.0/cl.md).
	> Compatibility patches must comply with its terms.
