# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a Compatibility Patch?**
A secondary mod designed to resolve conflicts or enable functionality between two or more mods.

**Can I monetize my Compatibility Patch?**
The Catch License does not forbid monetization, but platform rules, the original author's preferences, or community standards may discourage or prohibit it. Always check the mod author's policies and the platform's guidelines before monetizing or accepting donations.

**Can I use assets from the original mod?**
Only as much as needed to achieve compatibility. Using assets beyond that scope requires explicit permission from the original author.

**What if the original mod has stricter rules?**
The Catch License cannot override stricter terms set by the original mod's author. If the author's rules are more restrictive, you must follow them.
