# Asset Usage

The Catch License's asset rules (Section 4.4) exist to ensure that compatibility patches only use another mod's assets for their intended purpose: resolving conflicts and enabling interoperability.

**Key Principle:**
Use the original author's assets **only** when it's strictly necessary to achieve compatibility between mods. Any usage that goes beyond resolving specific conflicts is prohibited.

## Why the Imprecision?

It's often challenging to define the exact boundaries of a "compatibility issue" or determine which specific assets are needed. These rules are intentionally flexible to accommodate the wide variety of mods and scenarios.

If in doubt, ask yourself:

- Is the asset essential to fix a conflict or ensure the mods work together?
- Does the asset maintain or restore the intended functionality or appearance of the original mods?
- Am I respecting the original author's intent and permissions?

If you're still uncertain, consider asking the original author for clarification.

## Examples

### Permitted Uses

1. **Integrating New Weapons into Leveled Lists**
	- **Scenario:** Mod A adds unique weapons; Mod B modifies leveled lists for enemy gear. Without a patch, A's weapons never appear as intended.
	- **Solution:** The patch includes leveled lists referencing A's weapons.
	- **Why Allowed:** You're fixing a compatibility gapâ€”just enough to make the mods work together.

2. **Texture Alignment**
	- **Scenario:** Mod A changes building styles; Mod B adds unique lighting. Textures look glitchy together.
	- **Solution:** The patch adjusts Mod A's textures for compatibility with B's lighting.
	- **Why Allowed:** You're directly addressing a graphical incompatibility.

3. **Script Compatibility**
	- **Scenario:** Mod A adds follower behavior; Mod B changes follower AI. Together, they break followers.
	- **Solution:** The patch minimally edits scripts to ensure both mods function as intended.
	- **Why Allowed:** Script edits directly resolve a functionality conflict.

### Prohibited Uses

1. **Creating Unrelated NPCs**
	- **Scenario:** Using a character model from Mod A to create a new, unrelated NPC.
	- **Why Not Allowed:** The model isn't needed for compatibility; it's being repurposed as standalone content.

2. **Repurposing Textures for New Armor**
	- **Scenario:** Using Mod A's armor textures to make a new armor set unrelated to compatibility fixes.
	- **Why Not Allowed:** The textures aren't needed to solve a conflict; they're being used to create new content.

3. **Extracting Assets for Standalone Use**
	- **Scenario:** Taking Mod A's assets to place them in a new location unrelated to compatibility issues.
	- **Why Not Allowed:** Assets are not being used to resolve a compatibility problem.

## Communication and Permissions

Many mod authors are open to granting additional permissions if you ask. If you're unsure, reaching out for explicit permission is always best. Most authors welcome patches that respect their work, credit them properly, and don't monetize without approval.

**In Short:** Be cautious, considerate, and cooperative. If you use someone else's assets, make sure it's strictly for resolving compatibility issues, not for your own standalone creations.
